# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Assessing Water Quality Across Designated Refuge Water Bodies.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What are the trends in key water quality indicators (Turbidity, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Salinity, and Temperature) across different sampling locations in the refuge?
2. How do these indicators vary across the different water bodies: the Bay, D-Pool, C-Pool, B-Pool, and A-Pool?
3. Are there specific times of the year or conditions under which water quality shows notable changes?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project seeks to analyze water quality data collected from multiple designated locations within a refuge, including the Bay, D-Pool, C-Pool, B-Pool, and A-Pool. The data includes indicators such as Turbidity, pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Salinity, and Temperature. By exploring this data, the project aims to identify trends, variations, and any potential patterns that could impact the health of aquatic ecosystems within the refuge. These findings could be valuable for conservation efforts, helping to maintain or improve water quality across the refuge.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
